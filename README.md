My final project submission for my 3D Graphics and Animation Gaming course at Youngstown State University. The game is a low-poly clone of the first Call of Duty: World at War zombies map, Nacht der Untoten. Created with Unity

This project was a first attempt at a complete-package, playable 3D game with minimal bugs. I cut many corners because of time contraints but would like to revisit the project in my next game dev course, AI in Game Design.
